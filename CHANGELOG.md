## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Swarm: `file_delete` tool with WASI sandbox security hardening (path traversal, symlink escape, `/memory/` protection)
- Swarm: Lead `tool_call` protocol — Lead can invoke web_search, web_fetch, calculator directly
- Swarm: Lead `file_read` / `file_list` actions — zero LLM cost workspace file access
- Swarm: Conversation history injection for multi-turn context
- Swarm: HITL (human-in-the-loop) gateway infrastructure for Lead tool calls
- Desktop: Panel resize drag and React.memo optimization on RunConversation
- Desktop: Swarm message dedup and fetchFinalOutput fix

### Fixed
- Swarm: Drain running agents on budget exhaustion — prevents orphaned child workflows and incomplete synthesis results
- Swarm: Unify session ID validation across Go (p2p, lead_file_read) and Python (file_ops) — strict alphanumeric + hyphen + underscore only
- Swarm: Fix `tool_params` JSON schema from "string" to "object" to match Pydantic model, add warning logs on parse fallback
- Swarm: P2P version gates, `lenMust` safety guards, and fallback timeout
- Swarm: Closing checkpoint hardening and dependency-aware task filtering
- LLM service health endpoint reporting stale version "0.1.0"

### Changed
- Docker Compose: Add `:-` defaults to bare env var references (GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY, EXA_API_KEY, FIRECRAWL_API_KEY) to suppress warnings

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- Swarm V2 — Lead-orchestrated multi-agent system with parallel agent loops
- Channels system — Slack and LINE webhook integration (CRUD + inbound webhooks)

- Synthesis templates for swarm, domain analysis, and research output customization
- Workflow templates (8 example YAML workflows)
- Desktop: radar canvas with Lead pulse and swarm agent colors
- Research workflow tiered model architecture (50-70% cost reduction)

### Fixed
- Swarm AgentLoop tool tokens not accumulated into metadata totals
- Streaming manager send-to-closed-channel panic during shutdown
- Budget idempotency RLock/Lock TOCTOU race allowing duplicate token recording
- Lead HTTP timeout exceeding Temporal activity timeout
- Missing metadata on synthesis failure return path
- Leaked timer futures inflating Temporal workflow history
- Ignored workflow.Sleep error delaying cancellation
- CircuitBreaker data race and json.Marshal error handling
- Research model tier and agent output format
- Desktop workspace panel not resetting on session switch

### Changed
- Release compose: aligned timeout defaults with dev environment
- Release compose: added shannon-users volume and user memory env vars
- Install script: added all synthesis and workflow templates
- Regenerated proto files (SessionContext.user_id, ExecuteTaskResponse.metadata)
